# Calendar
C++ implementation of a CLI-based calendar.

## Overview
The project aims to emulate the behaviour of an agenda application:
the user can create tables and fill them with different types of data, such as integer numbers, floating point numbers, characters, strings, dates (dd/mm/yy) and time (hh:mm) data.
Such tables can be created, printed, saved, edited and deleted.
Same operations can be performed on columns and column objects; furthermore, column objects can be sorted by increasing and decreasing order.
Each column of a table can be identified by its name, which is a string, and tables are identified by their string names: everything is selected by the user input which can create a table by inserting 
its name and its columns.
